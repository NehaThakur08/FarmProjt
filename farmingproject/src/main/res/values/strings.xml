    <string name="barleySoil" translatable="false">Barley can be grown on a wide range of soil types;ranging from heavy clays to light or sandy loam soils.It grows well on fertile, deep loam soils with a pH of 6
to 7, 5. Soils with a pH lower than 6 may induce aluminium toxicity, leading to poor growth.</string>
    <string name="barleyIrrigation" translatable="false">Irrigation scheduling must be done according to evaporation and as per growth stage, because barley is more sensitive to stress during jointing, booting and heading.</string>
    <string name="barleyHarvest" translatable="false">Barley is ready for harvest in about 4 months after sowing.Barley can be harvested manually under small scale or combine harvesters can be used in large production scales</string>

    <string name="wheatIrrigation" translatable="false"> To harvest a good crop of wheat about 40 cm depth of water is used as evapotranspiration. There may be the need for 4-5 irrigations for wheat. In sandy loam soil 6-8 irrigations may be required whereas in heavy clay soil 3-4 irrigations are considered to be sufficient.</string>
    <string name="wheatHarvest" translatable="false">Wheat is harvested in the summer months, after being harvested in the spring or winter.
